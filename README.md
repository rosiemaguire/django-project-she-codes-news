# Rosie Maguire - She Codes News Project
## About This Project
This project uses HTML, CSS and the Django framework. It is a news website that allows users to read news stories, and authors to create them.

## Prerequisites
- `python`
- `pip`
- unrestricted execution policy (Windows requirement)
## How To Run This Code
- Clone a copy of this repo to your local machine. This can be done in the command line by navigating to the desired directory, then running:

        git clone https://github.com/rosiemaguire/django-project-she-codes-news.git
- Once you have a local version of this repository, you'll need to set up your virtual environment:
    -  navigate to the folder that contains the `requirements.txt` file
    - If you're on a windows machine, run the command 
            
            . venv/Scripts/activate
    - If you're on a mac, run the command 
            
            source venv/bin/activate
    - Install the Django library: 
            
            python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Check installation was successful: 
    
            python -m pip freeze
    - Change directory to where manage.py is located:
            
            cd she_codes_news
    - Make the inital migrations:
        
            python manage.py migrate
    - Load the template data for the news articles by running these two commands:
            
            python manage.py loaddata users
            python manage.py loaddata news
    - Now with everything set up, you'll just need to run the server!

            python manage.py runserver
    - Open http://localhost:8000/news to view and interact with the website
    - When you're finished press CTRL+C to quit the server
    - Deactivate the virtual environment by either using the command `deactivate` or terminate your terminal session.
